# Chat Application in Go

This is a simple chat application written in Go, using the Gorilla WebSocket library.

## Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run this application, you need to have the Go programming language installed. If you haven't already, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nerdferby/chat_go.git
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd chat_go
    ```

3. Build the Go application:

    ```bash
    go build -o chat-app
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the chat application by running the compiled binary:

    ```bash
    ./chat-app
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the chat application.

3. You can open multiple browser tabs or windows and chat with yourself or others in real-time.

## Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the code and templates. The main application logic can be found in `main.go`, and the HTML template is in the `templates` directory.
